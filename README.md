## Behold, The Optical Character Recognizer
This is a neural network with the ability to extract key pieces of text from a document. It does this using a combination of LSTMs and regular convolutions.

### Note:
This is a work in progress that should be completed sometime within the next couple days.

### Special Thanks:
Thanks to the wonderful people at [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras) for making a simpler version of an OCR system, which my work is baed off of. Also thank you to the creators of [YOLO 9000](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242), for giving me ideas and insight into this problem.
